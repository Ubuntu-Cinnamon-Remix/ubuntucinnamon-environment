Description: The environment for the Ubuntu Cinnamon desktop.
 The Ubuntu Cinnamon Environment is the Ubuntu Cinnamon desktop
 but comes with photos, and other applications that fit your touch at
 first glance, and is customizable to work anywhere, anytime you want at
 anytime you need.

Package: ubuntucinnamon-environment-live
Architecture: all
Depends: cinnamon-core, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Tweaks for Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix Live Session
 When the Ubuntu Cinnamon Remix ISO boots into Live Session, there are
 ownership problems for the Desktop directory as root owns it rather
 than the live user (cinnamon-remix).
 .
 To fix this, this package modifies the startup script for Cinnamon to
 change the ownership of the Desktop as the user is created on live
 bootup.
 .
 Do not install this on your main actual hardware with an installed
 system as this puts your Cinnamon at risk from starting up.
